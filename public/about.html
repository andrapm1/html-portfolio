<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Andra, and I’m a 20-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in Cybernetics. 
   I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human behavior, which is what drew me to this field. 
   I pride myself on being intelligent and focused, often diving deep into complex problems to find innovative solutions. 
   My organized approach helps me balance my studies and various interests effectively.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I consider myself quite sociable and love meeting new people. 
   Building connections is important to me, whether through group projects, networking events, or casual meet-ups.
   I thrive on challenges and actively seek out opportunities that push me beyond my comfort zone. This “challenge addiction” 
   drives my passion for coding and robotics, and I enjoy participating in hackathons where I can collaborate with 
   others and bring creative ideas to life.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I aspire to work in a cutting-edge tech company where I can contribute to advancements in
   artificial intelligence and robotics. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am 
   particularly passionate about encouraging young girls to explore STEM fields. 
   Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, volunteering, and continuously learning about the latest
   tech innovations. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!</p>
